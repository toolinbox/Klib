# 1. Klib: Live For Notes

## Focus on Now

The number of books we read is ever-increasing. If we consider all these books together, we will be lost.

**Klib is an app which groups all your read books together in one place. Your ‘read books’ group can be collapsed.** You can even hide the book list and only read the notes.

**Tips:**

- You can select multiple books and mark them as read. It's very useful after doing an import for the first time.
- If you usually read saved web pages in Kindle, with Klib you can merge them together as one book.
- How do you distinguish between highlights and notes?  Easy, Klib notes haves an ✍️ Emoji icon at the beginning of each entry.

## Review Notes in Kindle for macOS

When reviewing notes, you may want to read that part of the book again. In this case, **Klib can open Kindle for macOS and jump to the exact location**. Very cool and useful.

You can also press the `Space` bar in Klib to quickly preview the selected note. Feel familiar?

## Open With Amazon

When reviewing books we sometimes want to view the table of contents, customer reviews, or other books written by same author. In this case, **Klib can open the book on the Amazon site with one click.**

## Free to Edit

In Klib you can freely edit the book title, author, highlights, notes, etc.

### Mark as Chapter

Chapters are very important when review notes of a book. But unfortunately Kindle didn't export these information. How to do? Here is a way to walk around it.

- Add highlight for chapters' text.
- After imported into Klib, select all the highlights for chapters, mark them as chapters.
- When copy a book's highlights and notes, Klib will add 2nd level titles for chapters.

## Search Anything

You can search for any of the following content in Klib:

- Book title
- Author
- Note
  - Content
  - Location
  - Date

For example, if I want to search a note with the text `value` which I read in `2017`, just search `2017 value`.

In fact, this is why I developed Klib. After reading a book I like to summarise it in my blog. And the highlights and notes are important parts of the summary. So, I made Klib to copy them as Markdown.
